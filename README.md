How to export your Must watched movies (soon ratings also)

### ⚠ Work in progress: the site is available, however it may not function properly ⚠

_(in my experience I just had to retry it some time to get all of the movies)_

To get your Must username:
- on mobile: go to profile and touch your profile photo to get to the settings, then copy the "Nickname" (not the "Name"!), or share via link and then copy the username without the "@";
- on PC: simply login to <https://mustapp.com> and copy your username in the address bar without the "@" (ex. username in mustapp.com/@username)

At the moment the site is extremely bare bones and it doesn't have a loading animation so you have to wait patiently for less than a minute for the result,assuming you have inserted the right username.

## The site only gives IMDB IDS
Copy the full list and import it wherever you want. To import it in an IMDb list on your account I'd suggest using Tampermonkey and the IMDb importer script you can find online
