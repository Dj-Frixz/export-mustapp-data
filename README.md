How to export your Must data

https://dj-frixz.github.io/export-mustapp-data/

**Work in progress: the site is available, however it may not function properly**

To get your Must username:
- on mobile: go to profile and touch your profile photo to get to the settings, then copy the "Nickname" (not the "Name"!), or share via link and then copy the username without the "@";
- on PC: simply login to <https://mustapp.com> and copy your username in the address bar without the "@" (ex. https://mustapp.com/@username)

At the moment the site is extremely bare bones, it doesn't have a loading animation so you have to wait patiently for less than a minute for the result, if you have inserted the right username.
