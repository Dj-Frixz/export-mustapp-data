How to export your Must data

### ⚠ Work in progress: the site is available, however it may not function properly ⚠

To get your Must username:
- on mobile: go to profile and touch your profile photo to get to the settings, then copy the "Nickname" (not the "Name"!), or share via link and then copy the username without the "@";
- on PC: simply login to <https://mustapp.com> and copy your username in the address bar without the "@" (ex. username in mustapp.com/@username)

At the moment the site is extremely bare bones, it doesn't have a loading animation so you have to wait patiently for less than a minute for the result, if you have inserted the right username. 

If you just have a list of movies I suggest using [Titles To IMDB IDs](https://github.com/Prince25/Titles-To-IMDB-IDs) by [Prince25](https://github.com/Prince25), which I've personally tried and it works wonderfully, with the premise that it looks only at film titles so it could give the wrong result when encountering homonyms (ex. The Crow (1994) and The Crow (2024)).
